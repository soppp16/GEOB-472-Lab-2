Who did you design your map for? What questions or needs does the map attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your map successful and unsuccessful in this?

the map was inspireb by my personal experience that once I visited the Elizabeth Park, a old man fell down in front of me, and seem to be wounded. The old man's family was really anxious at that moment, because they  were not that familiar with the surroundings and don't where is the nearest hospital. recalling this experience after taking this class, I think I am able to conduct an interactive map to help the old man and his family to find out the location and name of the nearest or the most appropriate hospital around the park, and how far is the hospital from the park. In addition, to better visualized distances between hospitals and the park, I also create a 5km buffer to frame the hospitals within this area in order to highlight available nearby hospitals(fig.2), as a result, they could directly choice hosptial from this area without meansuring distances. By showing these information on this interactive map, I think this map would be effective to help the old man and his family to find out hospital more easily.

To conduct the map, series of map designs were used. Firstly, in order to show the Queen Elizabeth Park more clearly and creatively, I design a marker to highlight the loaction At the same time, the Queen Elizabeth Park as one of the most attractive and beautiful park in vancouver, I also add the image on the map to overlay the original map layer in order to add some visual effect. In addition, in order to let my audience to appreciate the map while understand my motivation for making it, I made a pop up information box to put the description of this scenario(fig.2). 

alone with these, a clickable button was also designed to 
What process did you follow in the design/iteration of the map? 
firstly, 
How does your map incorporate interactivity in a way that adds understanding? 
What are the intellectual justifications for your choices of data and cartographic stylings?
In what ways could your map be improved? 
Making reference to relevant cartographic/interaction principles you've learned in readings will improve your work.
