Who did you design your map for? What questions or needs does the map attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your map successful and unsuccessful in this?

the map was inspireb by my personal experience that once I visited the Elizabeth Park, a old man fell down in front of me, and seem to be wounded. The old man's family was really anxious at that moment, because they  were not that familiar with the surroundings and don't where is the nearest hospital. recalling this experience after taking this class, I think I am able to conduct an interactive map to help the old man and his family to find out the location and name of the nearest or the most appropriate hospital around the park, and how far is the hospital from the park. In addition, to better visualized distances between hospitals and the park, I also create a 5km buffer to frame the hospitals within this area in order to highlight available nearby hospitals(fig.2), as a result, they could directly choose a hosptial from this area without meansuring distances. By showing these information on this interactive map, I think this map would be effective to help the old man and his family to find out hospital more easily.

To conduct the map, series of map designs were used. Firstly, in order to show the Queen Elizabeth Park more clearly and creatively, I designed a marker to highlight the loaction At the same time, the Queen Elizabeth Park as one of the most attractive and beautiful park in vancouver, I added an image on the map to overlay the original map layer as well in order to add some visual effect. In addition, in order to let my audience to appreciate the map while understand my motivation for making it, I made a pop up information box to put the description of this scenario(fig.2). Furthermore, a clickable button was also designed to present the location and name of hospitals. Lastly, I used turf to create a 5km buffer and made a ruler on the map to measure distances and bearings between two points and sum of distance of points. 

After talking with Jingran, some improvements were suggested by her that the buffer should appear when audiences click the park marker istead of just lies on the screen before taking any action. I agreed with her, however, unfortunately, I did not figure out how to make this happen. also, there is one thing I hope to improve if I have chance that I want to make more interaction about turf. like changing the range of buffer for a specific point.
